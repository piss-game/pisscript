# pisscript

*A next-gen scripting language designed for modern software development*

## Overview

Pisscript, at its core, is a scripting language about bodily fluids. If, as it may be for many immature programmers,
this is too much to handle, you are welcome to choose a different language.

### Features
- Fully dynamic typing
- As many variables as you want
- Arithmetic operations

### Benefits
- Uses exclusively heap memory. Why have RAM if you're not gonna use it?
- Interpreted language running in an interpreted language. Runs faster than ever.
- Modern syntax built for the 21st century. Whatever that means.
- Better than Javascript. At least, according to most people.
- Piss. Haha piss.

## Hello World

```python
ejaculate "Hello, World!"
```

Keep in mind the careful use of the word *ejaculate* in this context. An entirely valid, albiet slightly outdated use of the word *ejaculate* means to "say something quickly and suddenly". In fact, the word was used in this context in Chapter 29 of the popular science-fiction novel *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* by J.K Rowling.

## Tubs

There are no variables in Pisscript, rather there are Tubs. Tubs can contain Piss or they can contain Words. The two are mutually exclusive. In layman's terms, Tubs can contain either numbers or strings. No distinction is drawn between integers and floating point numbers.

The existence of a tub with negative quantities of Piss will induce the creation of antimatter-Piss, a.k.a. Antipiss. Such an event will result in the violent anihilation of the Antipiss with the surrounding environment resulting in the destruction of the Earth as well as a segmentation fault.

## Arithmetic

Here is a program that adds two numbers together. The workings of this program should be fairly self-explanatory.

```python
tub a
fill a with 1

tub b
fill b with 2

pour b into a

tub message
fill message with "1 + 2 = "

measure a
stick a onto message

ejaculate message
```

## Installation and Usage
